# JS 101

Demo jQuery code for the MU Tech Talk on February 28, 2017.


## Get Started

In your terminal, run the following commands:

```
git clone git@github.com:zachfedor/mutech-js101.git
cd mutech-js101
npm install
npm start
```

The first will clone this code onto your computer. The next moves you to it. The third installs your dependencies. And the fourth will start serving it to your web browser.
